Personal YouTube Charts
=======================

Personal YouTube Charts is a Chrome extension that adds a ranking of your most viewed videos to the watch history page at https://www.youtube.com/feed/history


## Installing

The extension is not published in the Chrome webstore yet, so the only way to install this is to clone this repo and then load the extension unpacked from chrome://extensions/


## Caveats

- If you watch just part of a video on one day it counts as a view (as the video will appear in the watch history). So if you watch a long video, pausing and unpausing over multiple days, this will count as multiple views.


## License

The code is released under the MIT license included in this repository.
